Tire Tread SDK 13.0: [Release Notes](https://documentation.anyline.com/tiretreadsdk-component/latest/release-notes.html#13-0-3)

## 2.0.1

### Changed

- UI Behaviour is now aligned between Android and iOS. When the Default UI is disabled, no UI will be displayed neither on Android nor on iOS.

## 2.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- The `ScanOptions` class was removed.

  - The `tireTreadPlugin.scan()` function can now receive an instance of the new `TireTreadConfig` class to configure the Plugin instead.

### Added

- The `TireTreadConfig` class was introduced, enabling the configuration of a scan. It consists of:

  - `uiConfig`: Configuration for all UI-related settings and elements
  - `scanConfig`: Configuration for the scanning process parameters
  - `additionalContext`: Additional contextual information required for measurements

- The previous UI config properties have been reorganized under `uiConfig`:
  - `scanSpeed`
  - `measurementSystem`
  - `useDefaultUi`
  - `distanceIndicatorConfig`
  - `focusPointTooltipConfig`
  - `tapToStartScanningTooltipConfig`
  - `tireOverlayConfig`
  - `uploadViewConfig`
  - `orientationWarningConfig`
  - `countdownConfig`
  - `scanDirectionConfig`
  - `tireWidthInputConfig`
  - `missingPermissionConfig`

### Fixed

- Fixed a potential crash when parsing measurements with empty regional results
- Fixed NSInvalidArgumentException crash when using both the Anyline Mobile and Tire Tread SDKs in a single project.

## 1.2.1

### Dependencies

## 1.2.0

### Changed

- The default scan speed is now ScanSpeed.Fast.
  - The scan process will now, by default, take 7 seconds to be completed (instead of 10 seconds).
  - This configuration can still be changed by setting the scanSpeed property of the TireTreadScanView to ScanSpeed.Slow.

### Added

- The TireTreadScanView can now also be initialized without any config object/string.
  - In this scenario, the default config values will be used.
  - For more details, refer to the Scan Process - Overview page.

#### iOS

- Added support for iOS Simulator builds when using the SPM package
  - While the camera and scanning capabilites cannot be used in the simulator, the package from SPM now can also run on x64 and arm64 simulators, allowing running automated tests, or testing other features in your application.
